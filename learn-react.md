## React Fundamentals

### React Foundations

Follow the guide and use the quizzes to test your understanding

<https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations>

### Thinking in React

Take a look at this article by the official React team. This will be helpful for your upcoming challenge.

<https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react>

Well done!
With the fundamentals over you are ready for your first challenge..

## Tic-Tac-Toe

Your task is to create a playable tic-tac-toe in the browser!
Do not be afraid,
you won't be going on this journey alone.
We will follow the official React [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe),
but we hope you give it an earnest attempt yourself before you look at the "solution."

Lets take this step by step.
Trying to do everything in one go often leads to disaster.

### TODO: Project Setup

### Build the board

Start by getting a board of 3 by 3 squares on the page,
then try adding the ability to cross out the squares on click.

When your board looks something like this,
you should be ready to move to the next step.

### Handle the game logic

Now that your board is up and running,
it's time to implement the game logic.

Consider where it's best for your state to live.
It can be helpful to visualise the component tree of your game with a drawing.

### Time Travel

Add a new feature which lets the user travel back in time to an earlier state of the game board.
This one is tricky,
so don't fret if you find it challenging.

Congratulations!
You can officially add "game developer" and "React expert" to your LinkedIn profile ;)

## The rest

To learn the rest of React we would recommend going through the rest of the official React guides under "Learn React."

This might seem like a lot,
but those guides teach you like 80% of React functionality,
20% of which will be 90% of the code you write.

And after that, you're done!

On to the next blazingly fast JavaScript framework..
